		"answers": {
			"a": "Complete loss of QRS complexes",
			"b": "Reduction of baseline drift while preserving ECG morphology",

		"question": "Increasing the order of a Butterworth filter mainly results in:",
		"answers": {
			"a": "Wider transition band",

	{
		"question": "Why is a 0.5–40 Hz band-pass filter widely used in ECG preprocessing?",
		"answers": {
			"a": "It isolates power-line noise only",
			"b": "It preserves ECG information while removing low- and high-frequency noise",
			"c": "It blocks QRS energy",
			"d": "It eliminates phase distortion"
		},
		"correctAnswer": "b"

		"question": "When designing a window-based FIR filter using the windowing technique, how do the main-lobe width and side-lobe level of the chosen window function primarily affect the filter’s frequency response?",
		"answers": {
			"a": "Main-lobe width controls computational speed, while side-lobe level determines filter stability",
			"b": "Main-lobe width determines the sharpness of the transition band, while side-lobe level controls stopband attenuation and spectral leakage",
			"c": "Main-lobe width fixes the cutoff frequency exactly, while side-lobe level sets the filter order",
			"d": "Both main-lobe width and side-lobe level affect only the phase response of the filter"
		},
		"correctAnswer": "b"
