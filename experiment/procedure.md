**STEP 1:** Select an ECG Dataset from the dropdown menu. Adjust the Duration and Sampling Rate sliders as needed. Click the **"Generate ECG Signal"** button to visualize the original unfiltered ECG signal.

**STEP 2:** Select one or more noise types (Baseline Wander, Powerline, EMG Noise) using the checkboxes. Click the **"Add Noise to Signal"** button to observe the corrupted signal.

**STEP 3:** Configure the filter settings in the **Filter Design** section. Choose the Algorithm (IIR/FIR), Filter Type (Lowpass, Highpass, etc.), and set the Cutoff Frequencies and Order.

**STEP 4:** Click the **"Apply Filter"** button to process the noisy signal. Compare the Filtered ECG graph with the Noisy and Original signals to evaluate the filter's performance.

**STEP 5:** Click the <b>"Compute PSD"</b> button to
visualize the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the Noisy, and
Filtered signals. Observe the frequency components and compare the
filter's effect on the signal's spectrum.
