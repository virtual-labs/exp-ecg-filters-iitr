### Q1. When examining the “ECG Signal – Baseline Wander Contamination” plot in the simulation, baseline wander is visually identified as:

a) Very sharp, random spikes scattered throughout the signal  
b) The entire ECG waveform slowly drifting up and down over a period of several seconds  
c) Only the R-peak becoming progressively taller  
d) The signal becoming completely flat with no waveform variation  

### Q2. After applying a high-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of ~0.5 Hz, the most expected result is:

a) Complete loss of QRS complexes  
b) Reduction of baseline drift while preserving ECG morphology  
c) Removal of only 50 Hz interference  
d) Severe waveform distortion  

### Q3. Increasing the order of a Butterworth filter mainly results in:

a) Wider transition band  
b) Sharper roll-off and better stopband attenuation  
c) Loss of cutoff control  
d) Phase linearity  

### Q4. Why is a 0.5–40 Hz band-pass filter widely used in ECG preprocessing?

a) It isolates power-line noise only  
b) It preserves ECG information while removing low- and high-frequency noise  
c) It blocks QRS energy  
d) It eliminates phase distortion  

### Q5. When designing a window-based FIR filter using the windowing technique, how do the main-lobe width and side-lobe level of the chosen window function primarily affect the filter’s frequency response?

a) Main-lobe width controls computational speed, while side-lobe level determines filter stability  
b) Main-lobe width determines the sharpness of the transition band, while side-lobe level controls stopband attenuation and spectral leakage  
c) Main-lobe width fixes the cutoff frequency exactly, while side-lobe level sets the filter order  
d) Both main-lobe width and side-lobe level affect only the phase response of the filter
