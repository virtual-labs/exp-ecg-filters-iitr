### Q1. What is the primary purpose of filtering an ECG signal in clinical practice?

a) To increase the heart rate of the patient  
b) To remove unwanted noise and artifacts while preserving clinically important cardiac waveforms (P, QRS, T)  
c) To change the morphology of the ECG arbitrarily  
d) To amplify only the R-peak amplitude  

### Q2. Baseline wander in an ECG recording is characterized by:

a) Sharp random spikes superimposed on the ECG  
b) Low-frequency drift (0.6–0.7 Hz) caused mainly by patient respiration and movement  
c) 50/60 Hz sinusoidal noise from mains interference  
d) High-frequency oscillations above 100 Hz  

### Q3. A HIGH-PASS FILTER (HPF) is primarily used in ECG preprocessing to:

a) Remove high-frequency EMG muscle noise  
b) Remove baseline wander and very low-frequency drift (below ~0.5 Hz)  
c) Isolate only the QRS complex  
d) Eliminate 50/60 Hz power-line interference  

### Q4. A LOW-PASS FILTER (LPF) in ECG signal processing primarily helps in:

a) Removing slow baseline drift (baseline wander)  
b) Attenuating high-frequency noise such as muscle activity (EMG) and motion spikes  
c) Eliminating DC offset or mean value  
d) Removing only 50/60 Hz interference  

### Q5. Compared to Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, a key advantage of FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters in ECG applications is:

a) FIR filters always require fewer mathematical operations  
b) FIR filters can be designed to have exactly linear phase, which preserves the waveform shape and avoids phase distortion  
c) FIR filters automatically remove only power-line interference  
d) FIR filters eliminate the need for notch filtering
